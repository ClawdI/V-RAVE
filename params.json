Most people do not like the idea of\r\nhaving to give up complete control over their vehicle, especially in dangerous situations. The purpose\r\nof this project is to create a realistic environment for people to simulate the experience of being in\r\nvarious driving situations inside a self-driving vehicle. The goal is to potentially convince skeptics\r\nthat the capabilities of self-driving cars will make transportation safer and easier.\r\n\r\nWe have built an interactive, virtual-reality simulator that allows a user to experience both manually\r\ndriving through different scenarios and to observe how a self-driving car would handle the same\r\nscenario. The features of self-driving cars that are displayed are collision prediction and avoidance,\r\nsafe navigation in inclement weather, and adaptive cruise control. Our simulator could easily be used\r\nin studies to assess whether people become more inclined to use a self-driving car when shown some\r\nof the safety and convenience features that they will come with.\r\n\r\n### Demos\r\n\r\nCollision Avoidance\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_ogoTW2wlFU\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ogoTW2wlFU/hqdefault.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"VRAVE: Collision Avoidance\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAdaptive Cruise Control\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8s4cNmBEWtQ\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8s4cNmBEWtQ/hqdefault.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"VRAVE: Adaptive Cruise Control\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\nInclement Weather\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wbIzuXSWszI\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wbIzuXSWszI/hqdefault.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"VRAVE: Inclement Weather\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\n",
